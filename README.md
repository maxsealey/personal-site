# Max Sealey Personal Website

Front-end made with React

<br/>

The main branch contains the current branch that I'm working on, though you can see the other versions in v1, v2, v3

<br/>

To use on your local machine:

1. git clone <your SSH>

2. open in your IDE

3. in the terminal, type npm install

4. then, type npm start

5. to see another branch, use git switch <branch name>

<br/>

First version I was playing around with, though I found the background color boring.

Tried implementing background image, though getting it to translate and scale with a window resizing is tough. Might need to break out some good ol jQuery
