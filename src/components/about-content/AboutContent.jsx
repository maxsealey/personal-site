                    My name is Max Sealey, and I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in the Summer of 2024. 
                    Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio!<br/><br/>
                    Iâ€™m currently seeking for opportunities in the Spokane/Coeur d'Alene area (commuting is no issue) to contribute 
                    as a software developer, SQA engineer, web developer, data analyst, information security specialist, 
                    database or network administrator, systems architect, or IT specialist.
                    <br/><br/>
                    {/**My interest in coding began in 2014 when I learned C to program "Battle Bot" robots (3D printed parts, 
                    powered by an Arduino) for a high school competition. Later that year I learned HTML, CSS, and jQuery to develop
                    a dating service website for Start-up Weekend Spokane, a local hackathon/entrepreneurship competition.
